This project was done for CS4065 - Computer Networks and Networked Computing.
The first part of the project consisted of creating a web server that could process requests, returning the requested file (index.html, for example), and also printing the requests and responses to the terminal.
The second part of the project consisted of creating an FTP client that could send files via FTP (file transfer protocol) if the requested file was not on the local machine, but rather an external server.
